Stat Growth Formula & Thoughts
==============================

For stats, average weapon attacks against other characters of the same level should require
about 7 hits to kill them.

Final base HP/SP -- probably 5,000 and 500
Starting numbers... 150 and 30?

Other stats -- 10 to 1000

Evasion/m.evasion possibly stays at 0, only races/jobs can make it go up.
Range can go from 0 to 10,000, divide by 100 to get percentages.
Only races should get good base evasion to prevent people mastering one
job and swapping to a high-eva job for a free boost. lv-up evasion can
come from either source.

Defenses
--------

Defense/m.defense formula is: reduction% = defense / (30 * attacker_level + defense)

3000 -> 4000
50% -> 57.143%

6000 -> 7000
66.7% -> 70%


10,000 damage...

5000 -> 4286 -- 714 less damage -- 14.2% reduction
3333 -> 3000 -- 333 less damage -- 11.1% reduction
